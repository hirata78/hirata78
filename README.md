### Here is a little of how I became a future Data Analyst, living in Japan 44 years old Brazilian, husband, and father of three, who loves communication, marketing, math, technology, physics, philosophy…

I graduated in Public Relations and, as an intern at an Engineering Cooperative, I successfully evaluated and improved its communication system, and worked with the marketing department suggesting the segmentation of its services and products, a key strategy to fortify the company in each acting market.

When I came to Japan for the first time, I worked mainly in manufacturing, but I also had an opportunity to fill in as a math teacher at a school for Brazilians. I engaged the students and increased their math performance by focusing on communication.

Returning to Brazil, I managed Embraer’s news electronic clipping at a communication agency. Performed the news dataset categorization, creation of a semestral report, and presentation to Embraer’s communication department.

In Japan again, after becoming fluent in Japanese, besides manufacturing, I've worked in sales, translation, and English online privet lessons.

Lately, studying programming, I considered diverse careers and choose data that combines what I enjoy most: technology, math, communication, problem-solving…

I’ve always had pleasure learning new things, so I’m having lots of fun learning Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and studying more statistics.

I’m thrilled to join my soft skills with my newly acquired technical ones and take on new challenges.

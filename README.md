As a Communication and Public Relations bachelor, I acquired experience in planning and managing communication systems, opinion surveys, and working with marketing departments.

In Japan, I worked in manufacturing and as a math teacher at a school for Brazilians. Acquiring fluency in Japanese, I also worked in sales, translation, and Japanese and English privet lessons.

Lately, I started to pursue data fluency, combining it with my soft skills to solve problems through data-driven insights.

Iâ€™m thrilled to take on new challenges, continue learning, and grow on this path.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is a little of how I became a future Data Analyst, living in Japan, 44 years old Brazilian, husband, and father of three, who loves communication, marketing, math, technology, physics, philosophyâ€¦

In high school, math came quickly to me, and, as I had no clue of what to do when I graduated, I went to study it at college. However, the math became too abstract, and adding a bicycle accident with more than three months at the hospital to the equation; I decided to study something else. I still enjoy math thought.

Then I started to work with events and adored planning, communicating, and working with people, so I graduated in Public Relations when I also fell in love with marketing. Before finishing my bachelorâ€™s, I started to work at an Engineering Cooperative, where I successfully evaluated and improved its communication system. I also worked with the marketing department suggesting the segmentation of its services and products, a key strategy to fortify the company in each acting market.

When my firstborn came, and I needed to earn more money, I decided to go to Japan. I worked mainly in manufacturing and was immersed in a completely different culture; it was challenging but made me grow. Besides, in this period, I also had an opportunity to fill in as a math teacher at a school for Brazilians, and I loved teaching!

After three years, I returned to Brazil and worked at a communication agency with a SQL database for clipped electronic news. I managed Embraerâ€™s news electronic clipping team and was responsible for the news categorization, creation of a semestral report, and presentation to Embraerâ€™s communication department. I have already been doing some analytics here.

Still, again I decided to return to Japan, and this time I studied Japanese more seriously, met my wife and had two wonderful kids. After becoming fluent in Japanese, I've worked in various fields, from sales and translation to math, English, and Japanese teaching and manufacturing.

For the last five years, I have worked as a regular employee at a parts manufacturing company and, besides giving online English and Japanese classes, started studying programming. After considering the diverse careers, I choose data that combines what I enjoy: technology, math, communication, problem-solvingâ€¦

Iâ€™ve always loved learning new things, so I have lots of fun learning Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and studying more statistics.
Iâ€™m thrilled to join my soft skills with my newly acquired technical ones and take on new challenges.
